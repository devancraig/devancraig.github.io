### City of Boise — Parks Tree Viewer
<p>The goal of this project was to replicate a windows application that was currently being used and turn it into a web application. The existing data was already in a sql database. Taking the sql data I created views to match the existing application. I Then built the web application using .NET Core with razor pages and some telerik nuget packages for the data tables.</p><br>
